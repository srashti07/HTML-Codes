# Create Two Variations of Headers

## Context
Every newspaper has a nameplate. It’s just about the only thing you can guarantee won’t change from edition to edition. It’s the bit at the top of the front page, and comprises of the publication’s name and logo.

A lot of these are iconic in their own right. The nameplates of publications like The Washington Post and The Sun are seared into the public consciousness. Nameplates are the branding, the bit that says, ‘We’re not that other newspaper. We’re this newspaper.’ It communicates who you are and what you’re about.

Practically every website has a nameplate, only on websites we call it the header.  It’s weird for a website not to have one, and for it not to appear on every page. In news and web design the underlying purpose of the nameplate is the same: **get the brand front and centre and guide users to something they’ll care about**.
