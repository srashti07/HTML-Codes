## Develop a responsive web page for Masai Mara Wildlife Sanctuary 

## Context

Masai Mara Wildlife Sanctuary is a haven for the rich biodiversity found within its lush forests. It's dedicated to preserving and protecting various species of animals and plants and fostering a strong connection between nature and people. ​

Now, Masai Mara Wildlife NGO wants to conserve nature and preserve it from the most pressing threats to the diversity of life on earth. This NGO has yet to have a web presence, and because of this, it cannot reach a wider audience and accomplish its mission. A more comprehensive web presence would increase its monetary contribution and encourage voluntary participation from individuals. ​

Also, the millennials are most active in providing support to the organization. Hence, the organization is very keen on reaching out to the millennials with the information in the best possible way so that the information is well utilized. ​

The organization wanted to develop a responsive web page to be a digital gateway for all visitors to learn about the sanctuary, explore its beauty, and engage with its mission. As a preliminary step, they wanted to create a responsive web page in a day to get a preview of that, which can be later enhanced. ​
