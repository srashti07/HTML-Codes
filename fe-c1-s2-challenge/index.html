        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>W3C is a growing and global community where participants choose to work together. W3C is committed tomaintaining a positive working
             environment, where each participant feels appreciated and respected andwhere everyone adheres to the same high level of standards of
              personal behavior. In that process weexperience differences in language, location, nationality, and experience. In such a diverse
               environment,misunderstandings and disagreements happen, which in most cases can be resolved informally.<br>
               <br>

               W3C's <i>Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</i>(CEPC) is useful to define accepted and acceptablebehaviors and to promote high standards of professional 
                practice. The goal of this code of conduct is toensure that W3C is an environment where everyone can participate without fear
                of harassment. It alsoprovides a benchmark for self evaluation and acts as a vehicle for better identity of the organization.<br>
                <br>
                The CEPC is complemented by a set of <a href="https://www.w3.org/about/positive-work-environment/#Procedures">Procedures</a>, applies to any member of the W3C community – staff,members, invited experts,
                 and participants in W3C meetings, W3C teleconferences, W3C mailing lists, coderepositories, W3C conferences or W3C functions, etc.
                 etings, W3C teleconferences, W3C mailing lists, coderepositories, W3C conferences or W3C functions, etc. Note that this code
                  complements rather than replaceslegal rights and obligations pertaining to any particular situation</p>

        <h2>Statement of Intent</h2>
        <p>W3C is committed to maintaining a <b>positive</b> work environment. This commitment calls for a workplacewhere participants at all levels 
            behave according to the rules of the following code. A foundational concept of this code is that we all share responsibility for our work environment.

        <section>
            <h3>Expected Behavior</h3>
            <p>Treat each other with respect, professionalism, fairness, and sensitivity to our many differences andstrengths, including in situations
             of high pressure and urgency.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Appreciate and accommodate our similarities and differences. We come from many cultures andbackgrounds, ways of life, and standards
                 of behavior. Cultural differences can encompass everythingfrom official religious observances to personal habits to clothing. 
                 Be respectful of people with differentpractices, attitudes, and beliefs. To help us achieve and maintain these high standards, 
                 each individualparticipant is expected to share responsibility for our work environment by adhering to the behavioral guidelines herein.</li>
                <li>Have empathy when discussing sensitive issues. Some participants may have experienced (or beensubjected to)
                 various forms of violence in their lives, which may cause distress when they arereminded of it. Avoid making jokes or callously
                  mentioning sexual violence such as stalking or sexualassault; in cases when the need arises to discuss these issues and how they
                   affect people - do so withtact and empathy taking into account the gravity of the situation, and make sure that pa</li>
                <li>appropriately warned in advance so they can choose to step out of these discussions.Treat everyone with respect. We are a large
                 community of people who are passionate about our work,sometimes holding strong opinions and beliefs. We are committed to dealing
                  with each other withcourtesy, respect, and dignity at all times. Misunderstandings and disagreements do happen. Whenconflicts 
                  arise, we are expected</li>
                <li>Do not accept or engage in abusive behavior in any form, whether it is verbal, physical, sexual, or implied.</li>
                <li>Be honest. Be truthful, sincere, forthright and, unless professional duties require confidentiality orspecial discretion, 
                candid, straightforward, and frank</li>

            <h3>Unacceptable Behavior</h3>
            <p><i>Unacceptable behaviors</i> run counter to the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct. This list ofunacceptable behaviors does not cover
             every case. Each person you interact with is unique, and behaviormust be assessed on an individual level. Ensuring that your behavior
              does not have a negative impact is yourresponsibility</p>
        
            <p>Unacceptable behavior include, but are not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and gender expression, sexual orientation,disability (both visible and
                 invisible), mental health, neurotype, physical appearance, body, age, race, socio-economic status, ethnicity, caste, nationality, language, or religion</li>
                <li>Unwelcome comments regarding a person's lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment</li>
                <li>ood, health, parenting, drugs, and employmentMisgendering someone by deliberately referring to a person using the wrong pronouns or by usingsomeone's proper 
                names or other terms that person has asked not to be used, also known as deadnaming.
                </li>
                <li>Microaggressions, which are small comments or questions, either intentional or unintentional, that
                marginalize people by communicating hostile, derogatory, or negative beliefs. Examples include:
                </li>
                <details open>
                    <summary>
                    Patronizing language or behavior:
                    </summary>
                 <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
                    <li>
                        Be aware that, regardless of the speaker's intentions, some phrases or constructions leadpeople to expect a patronizing
                         statement to follow, and avoid such phrases. For example,beginning an intejection with "Well, actually..." can set this expectation and be taken 
                         as a sign of disrespect.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Assuming without asking that particular people or groups need concepts defined orexplained to them. It’s great to be sensitive
                         to the fact that people may not be familiar withtechnical terms you usse every day, but assuming that people are uninformed can come 
                         across as patronizing.
                    </li>
                    <li>Assuming that particular groups of people are technically unskilled (e.g., “So easy your grandmother could do it”).</li>
                 </ul>
                
            </details>
            <li>Retaliating, or taking adverse action, against anyone who files a complaint that someone has violatedthis code of conduct.</li>

                Safety versus Comfort
            </h3>
            <p>
                This Code prioritizes the safety of individuals, particularly those in marginalized communities, over the comfort of others, for example in situations involving:
                <ul>
                    <li>"Reverse" -isms, including "reverse racism," "reverse sexism," and "cisphobia".</li>
                    <li>Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you”</li>
                    <li>Communication in a tone you don’t find congenial.</li>
                    <li>Criticisms of racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions.</li>
                </ul>

        <h2>Reporting Violations and Supporting the Code</h2>
        <p>If you are concerned about your immediate safety, contact <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_emergency_telephone_numbers">local emergency services</a>. For a face to face eventyou may need to contact
             venue staff for assistance contacting emergency services.
             <br>
             <br>
             In most instances if you have an issue with someone’s behavior along the
              lines of this Code then please raiseit; there are a few potential people you could raise it to depending on your situation and your
               safety.
               <br>
               <br>
               In most cases, issues are best resolved at the source. Accordingly, raising the issue with the group chair orteam contact of
                the relevant group is usually the best first place to raise an issue. Group chairs and team contacts also have more of the context
                 which helps them address the issue.</p>
